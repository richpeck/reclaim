<title>What is Car Hire Excess Insurance?</title>
<div><p>Hiring a car whilst on holiday can be a fantastic way to explore the local area. However, renting a car abroad can be worrying, even for the most experienced drivers. You might not be familiar with the roads and the region, you may not know where is safe to park, not to mention getting to grips with road signs and traffic warnings in a foreign language!&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst your rental agreement may include some insurance for theft and third party liability, it’s up to you, however, to decide how to cover the risk of damage to or theft of the car itself.</p><p>You have three main options, all described below: buying a “collision damage waiver” (CDW) through the car-rental company (easiest but most expensive), using your credit card’s coverage (not always available), or getting collision waiver coverage from a 3rd party.</p><p><strong>Car-Rental Company CDW</strong></p><p>When you pick up your rental car, the counter staff might offer you extra types of cover. The simplest solution is to buy a CDW supplement from the car-rental company. This coverage technically isn’t insurance; rather, it’s a waiver: The car-rental company waives its right to collect a high deductible from you in the event the car is damaged. CDW generally costs $10–30 a day.</p><p>Credit-Card Coverage</p><p>By paying with the right credit card, you get zero-deductible collision coverage (comparable to “super” CDW)...likely for free. In other words, if your car is damaged or stolen, your credit card will cover whatever costs you’re liable for. The only major downside: If you do end up in an accident, dealing with credit-card coverage can be more of a hassle than what you’d encounter with the car-company CDW.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.carinsurent.com/">Collision Damage Waiver Coverage</a> Through Carinsurent.com</p></div>
