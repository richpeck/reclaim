<h2>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2>
<p>Firstly, we&#39;ll need to see the documents provided by your leasing or car rental provider. This normally includes a vehicle collection inspection report and/or a vehicle appraisal (including images), plus your itemised damage invoice, repair estimate or damage excess compensation claim.&nbsp;You can do this electronically or by post (copies are fine).</p>
<p>You&#39;ll also need to give us permission to act on your behalf by signing a simple document to this effect which includes our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.damagereclaim.com/terms">terms and conditions</a>. Then, we can begin the process of assessing your case and communicating directly with the leasing or car rental company to deliver the fair result you deserve.</p>

<h2>FAIR OUTCOMES, GUARANTEED.</h2>
<p>We approach your damage bill with professionalism and integrity, ensuring we have the best possible chance of success. In some cases, it may be that your charges are completely justified. If so, we won&rsquo;t waste your time and money; as we only charge for successful bill reductions, we independently assess every case before taking it on.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>HOW MUCH WILL IT COST ME?</h2>
<p>Our pricing structure is geared around you. If we don&#39;t save you money, we don&#39;t charge you a penny! Of course in most cases we do save money, and we&#39;ll just take a proportion of this saving, so you&#39;re guaranteed not to lose under any circumstances. See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.damagereclaim.com/rates">our&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.damagereclaim.com/rates">service rates</a>&nbsp;page for an in depth breakdown.</p>

<h2>HOW AND WHEN DO I PAY?</h2>
<p>Once we&#39;ve processed your case and made a saving we&#39;ll let you know via email. At that point, we&#39;ll return your amended invoice from the leasing company and process your payment for the relevant amount as detailed in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.damagereclaim.com/rates">our service rates</a>&nbsp;information. We do not pay the leasing or rent a car company - you have to do that separately.</p>
<p>We will then invoice you for our services in reducing your damage invoice and this will need to be paid within 7 days. &nbsp;We accept all major credit and debit cards, PayPal and Bank Transfer. &nbsp;If&nbsp;<a href="https://www.damagereclaim.com/im-a-business">you are a business</a>we recognise that your fleet size and profile may allow us to be flexible with our T&amp;C&#39;s to accommodate your business needs.</p>
