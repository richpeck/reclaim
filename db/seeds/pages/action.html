<h2>UNDERSTANDING YOUR POSITION</h2>
<p>Amidst all the excitement of choosing a new car, it&rsquo;s easy to lose sight of the small print. Even if you do take a close eye to the terms and conditions, leasing companies and finance providers are notorious for testing the boundaries with end of contract charges.</p>

<p>To understand your position and assess whether the charges are warranted, it&rsquo;s essential to ask yourself a few questions:<br />
<br />- Does the damage to your vehicle go beyond fair wear and tear?</p>
<p>- Were you made aware of the consequences of not returning your vehicle in the appropriate state of repair?</p>
<p>- Is the damage charge reasonable for the scope of repair work?</p>
<p>If your answer to these questions is &lsquo;no&rsquo;, you might have grounds to make a case against the compensation claim made by your leasing or finance provider. We can help you do just that.</p>
<p>With our support, you can push back against your leasing company or finance provider, and minimise the amount you have to pay. And if your bill is appropriate and we haven&rsquo;t reduced it, we won&rsquo;t charge you for our time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t sit back and accept unfair or excessive demands when it&rsquo;s time to return your car. Let our experts fight your corner.</p>
