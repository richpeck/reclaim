<title>Car & Van Rental (CVR)</title>

<p>Vehicle rental is a hugely convenient alternative to buying a car or van. There are many reasons why we might need to hire one, and most people go out of their way to ensure they are returned in the same condition as they were handed over.</p>
<p>No-one wants to return a damaged hire car and face the resulting damage bill. But unfortunately, in some cases, this is inevitable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After signing the rental agreement in branch or at the point of delivery, you should have an opportunity to inspect the vehicle prior to taking the keys. This ensures that you are happy with the condition of the vehicle, and that any relevant items of damage already present are marked down by the agent.</p>
<p>Rental companies use this information when you return the vehicle, to assess whether any additional damage has occurred during the hire period. The end of contract inspection can be nerve-wracking, but in most cases there&rsquo;s no need to worry, especially if the company in question is a member of the BVRLA.</p>
<p>However, if your vehicle has experienced wear and tear, or you hired the vehicle from a business that isn&rsquo;t BVRLA registered, you may receive an unexpected damage bill. In many cases, these charges are unfair, and even represent malpractice&hellip;</p>
