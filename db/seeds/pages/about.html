  <h2>YOU&#39;RE NOT ALONE.</h2>
  <p>Drivers fork out over &pound;50 million every year for &lsquo;damage&rsquo; on returned lease vehicles or car rental companies claim for compensation. A huge portion of these charges are unjustified profit-making activity that goes unchallenged by businesses and the general public.</p>

<h2>SHOULD I PAY UP?</h2>
<p>Not necessarily. If you believe that these charges are unfair, or that minor dents, scrapes and scratches constitute &lsquo;fair wear and tear&rsquo;, you might have a case to reduce your damage charges.&nbsp; Often damage was present when taking out the initial car rental agreement and it&#39;s not unknown car rental companies to falsely claim compensation twice.</p>
