<title>What documents will I need?</title>
<p>We'll need to see the documents provided by your leasing company or finance provider. This normally includes a vehicle collection report and/or a vehicle appraisal (including images), plus your itemised damage invoice. You can do this electronically or by post (copies are fine).</p>
