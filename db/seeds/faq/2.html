<title>How do I pay for the service?</title>
<p>Once we've processed your case and made a saving we'll let you know via email. At that point, we'll return your amended invoice from the leasing company and process your payment for the relevant amount as detailed in <a href="https://www.damagereclaim.com/our-rates">our service rates</a>&nbsp;information. We do not pay the leasing company - you have to do that separately.</p>
<p>We will then invoice you for our services in reducing your damage invoice and this will need to be paid within 7 days. &nbsp;We accept all major credit and debit cards, PayPal and Bank Transfer. &nbsp;If you are <a href="/im-a-business-save-me-money-on-damage-recharges">a business</a>&nbsp;we recognise that your fleet size and profile may allow us to be flexible with our T&amp;C's to accommodate your business needs.</p>
