# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  claim:
    intro:        "Our mutual client <b><u>%{client}</u></b> has completed a third-party authority form instructing Damage Reclaim to deal with your claim for compensation. This form gives authority for Damage Reclaim to act on their behalf and all future correspondence should be directed to us. <b><u>%{client}</u></b> returned their rental vehicle from <b><u>%{from}</u></b> to <b><u>%{to}</u></b> and we would like to complain regarding the damage invoice received / deducted outlined in the following points:"
    insurance:    "Our client wasn't made aware of the insurance and damage excess waiver cover prior to commencement of the rental agreement and if the options were explained and had been made clearer they would have taken out the necessary requirements."
    signed:       "As a signed condition report was not provided on commencement of the rental we believe the damage was pre-existing prior to check out unless you can provide evidence otherwise."
    shown:        "Our client was not shown around the vehicle prior to commencement of the vehicle and we are disputing the invoice as we believe the damage was present at point of collection.  Our client was unaware they needed to inspect the vehicle fully and the damage reported is the type of damage we would only expect a trained and qualified Inspector to identify, so we insist that the damage was pre-existing prior to commencement of the rental.  Please can you provide previous recent check in reports evidencing that this vehicle was not damaged prior to collection."
    inspected:    "Considering the environmental conditions our client had picked the vehicle up in, it is reasonable that the damage not recorded could have already present prior to commencement of the rental.  Our client was also not made aware that if damage had been found following the commencement of the rental that this had to be reported in a timely manner."
    employee:     "On return of the vehicle there was no person present to handover the keys too and complete an inbound inspection.  Give the timing difference from drop off to inspection, our client can only assume this damage was caused in your possession unless you can provide evidence otherwise."
    noted:        "Our client notes that when handing the vehicle back that the damage charged for was not identified on the inbound check in, therefore disputed that was caused by them (list damage missed)"
    acknowledge:  "Without admission of liability, our client insists the damage wasn‚Äôt caused by them and to try and pass on unreasonable charges is blatant profiteering and evidence of further malpractice in the rental industry.  However, if we were to propose a reduced amount of (X) to our client, they may well be willing to settle the claim without admission of liability."
    report:       "As there is no signature on the inbound condition report our client disputes that this was actually a true reflection of the vehicle at time of check in and believes that the damage identified was caused after handover unless you can evidence otherwise."
    subsequent:   "Our client disputes that the damage identified was caused by them as they have a signed condition report by both parties stating that this is an accurate reflection of the vehicle condition at time of handover.  To state there is further damage been identified after the handover is unreasonable and our client does not accept this and can only assume this happened after handover unless you can provide evidence otherwise."
    card:         "Our clients card has already been debited and this wasn‚Äôt pre-authorised giving them the opportunity to review or approve that this is a fair and reasonable charge, therefore we request that this is reviewed. "
    invoice:      "The damage reported on the inbound check in doesn‚Äôt match the damage reported on the invoice.  Therefore we can only assume the differing damage was caused after the handover of the vehicle unless you can provide evidence otherwise."
    images:       "Images"
    repair:       "The costs to repair the vehicle are unreasonable. Our industry knowledge indicates that a fair repair charge would be (X%) less. We have run the same repairs through our Thatcham and Audatex systems and the prices over inflated and blatant profiteering. Putting a revised claim for compensation to our client, this would be accepted and settled straight away."
    method:       "Investigating the severity of the damaged charged for and the evidence provided and utilising our extensive knowledge and repair techniques and methods, the repair method applied for this type of damaged is over exaggerated and therefor falsely inflating the costs to our client."
    additional:   "Whilst acknowledging these costs have been applied are they really fair and transparent considering that in most cases you won‚Äôt be getting the vehicle repaired until a later date.  This is penalising our client twice for the alleged damage caused which is blatant profiteering on your behalf unless you can provide evidence otherwise."
    vat:          "As you have applied VAT to the estimate/invoice we can only assume you will be getting the vehicle repaired and therefore we request evidence that this has been completed, otherwise please remove this element from the final bill."
